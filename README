= tb - manipulation tool for table: CSV, TSV, etc.

tb provides a command and a library for manipulating tables:
Unix filter like operations (grep, sort, cat, etc.),
SQL like operations (join, group, etc.),
and more.

== Example

There is a CSV file for programming languages and their birth year in
sample/ directory in tb package.

  % head sample/langs.csv
  language,year
  FORTRAN,1955
  LISP,1958
  COBOL,1959
  ALGOL 58,1958
  APL,1962
  Simula,1962
  SNOBOL,1962
  BASIC,1964
  PL/I,1964

"tb" command has many subcommands.
"sort" subcommand sort a CSV file.
You don't need to care header: header is retained as is.

  % tb sort sample/langs.csv|head
  language,year
  ALGOL 58,1958
  APL,1962
  Ada,1983
  B,1969
  BASIC,1964
  BCPL,1967
  C,1972
  C#,2001
  C++,1980

"sort" subcommand takes -f option to specify a field to sort.
You don't need to count the position of the field.
Also, the comparison method used in tb is smart to sort numbers correctly.

  % tb sort -f year sample/langs.csv|head
  language,year
  FORTRAN,1955
  LISP,1958
  ALGOL 58,1958
  COBOL,1959
  APL,1962
  SNOBOL,1962
  Simula,1962
  BASIC,1964
  PL/I,1964

"grep" subcommand search CSV file.

  % tb grep R sample/langs.csv
  language,year
  FORTRAN,1955
  Ruby,1993

"grep" subcommand takes -f with field name and -v to show non-matching rows.
You don't need to care field separators (comma) to match.
Following example searches languages which uses non-alphabet characters in the name.

  % tb grep -vf language '\A[A-Za-z]*\z' sample/langs.csv |cat
  language,year
  ALGOL 58,1958
  PL/I,1964
  C++,1980
  Objective-C,1983
  Common Lisp,1984
  Visual Basic,1991
  C#,2001
  F#,2002

"grep" subcommand can take Ruby expression, instead of a regexp.

  % tb grep --ruby '(1990..1999).include?(_["year"].to_i)' sample/langs.csv
  language,year
  Haskell,1990
  Python,1991
  Visual Basic,1991
  Ruby,1993
  Lua,1993
  CLOS,1994
  Java,1995
  Delphi,1995
  JavaScript,1995
  PHP,1995
  D,1999

"select" subcommand extract one or more fields.
This is similar to "cut" command of Unix and projection of relational algebra.

  % tb select language sample/langs.csv |head
  language
  FORTRAN
  LISP
  COBOL
  ALGOL 58
  APL
  Simula
  SNOBOL
  BASIC
  PL/I

"group" subcommand groups rows for specified field.
-a option specifies aggregation expression to aggregate the grouped rows.

  % tb group year -a count -a 'values(language)' sample/langs.csv |head
  year,count,values(language)
  1955,1,FORTRAN
  1958,2,"LISP,ALGOL 58"
  1959,1,COBOL
  1962,3,"APL,Simula,SNOBOL"
  1964,2,"BASIC,PL/I"
  1967,1,BCPL
  1968,1,Logo
  1969,1,B
  1970,2,"Pascal,Forth"

There are more subcommands.
"help" subcommand shows list of subcommand.

  % tb help

    tb help [OPTS] [SUBCOMMAND]
